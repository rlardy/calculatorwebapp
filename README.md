# How to use
Open [https://calculator-sezzle-53033.web.app/](https://calculator-sezzle-53033.web.app/) to view it in the browser.

Enter in the Left-Hand side of your math equation (before the =) into the text field. Then press calculate and watch as the calculation appears in the logs.

For example, user A and user B go to your app at the same time. User A calculates “5 + 5”, which equals “10". This is logged below the calculator as “5 + 5 = 10”. User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates “3 x 4".This calculates to “12” and displays “3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.
# Project Definition
Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest. The calculator only needs to implement basic arithmetic operations, although you can add other math functions if you would like to impress. But don't forget to meet the basic requirements of the exercise first!

The app must be hosted and deployed to be publicly accessible to engineers at Sezzle so that we can grade the project. The deliverables include both the deployed application and the source code hosted at a site like Github.

*Dear Sezzle Engineers, my firebase configuration data has been abstracted to a text file included in .gitignore in order to keep security of the database.*
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `firebase deploy`

Deploys the latest production build of the application to Firebase.\
Open [https://calculator-sezzle-53033.web.app/](https://calculator-sezzle-53033.web.app/) to view it in the browser.

This web application is hosted for free using Google Firebase.
